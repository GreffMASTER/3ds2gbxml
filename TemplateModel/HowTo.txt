For use with TM 1.0 only, experimental use only, collisions are unfinished

Here is a template for converting 3ds files to TrackManias Solid files in a form of xml that need to be compiled using `gbxc`
You can find `gbxc` here: https://github.com/GreffMASTER/gbxc
Made for block models

1. Use `3ds2gbxc.py` on your 3ds model
2. You will get 2 files for each object in the file, visual mesh and collision mesh
3. Edit the Template.Solid.xml and ModelElements.CPlugTree.xml files and follow the steps there
4. Compile the Template.Solid.xml file with `gbxc`

Tested with blender 2.79 3ds models and plugins for modern blender
Also supports vertex colors (partially) with custom plugin fork: https://github.com/GreffMASTER/blender_export_tmf
