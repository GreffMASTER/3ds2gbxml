How to create a custom Solid file using 3ds. GreffMASTER 2023-2025

Created for use with TM 1.0, works in later games. This project is still very much in development. Expect bugs and issues.

Here is a template for converting 3ds files to TrackManias Solid files in a form of xml that need to be compiled using `gbxc`.
You can find `gbxc` here: https://github.com/GreffMASTER/gbxc.

1. Use `3ds2gbxc.py` on your 3ds model: python 3ds2gbxc.py model.3ds -vs
2. You will get visual mesh files for each object as well as a single collision mesh file of all objects
3. Edit the Template.Solid.xml, Root.CPlugTree.xml, ModelElements.CPlugTree.xml and Model.CPlugTree.xml files and follow the steps there
4. Compile the Template.Solid.xml file with `gbxc`

Tested with blender 2.79 3ds models and plugins for modern blender
Also supports vertex colors and multiple uv layers with custom plugin fork: https://github.com/GreffMASTER/blender_export_tmf (for blender 3.6.0)

To set a surface type for a model object, give it a material with one of these names (case sensitive):
